  <h3>JavaScript Exercises: Program Structure</h3>

  <p>
    Complete each of the following numbered exercises in the &lt;script&gt; tag.
    You'll need to view this document in a text editor and make your changes.
    Keep the console open and refresh (reload) the page after each change to see the result.
  </p>

  <script type="text/javascript">

    // Complete the following javascript exercises

    // 1. Create a variable named `age`. Assign a number to it.
    // -  Use an `if-else` statement to print out "Age is over 21" when the age is over 21,
    // -  Otherwise print out "Age is under 21". Change the value of age to be sure your statement is working
    var age = 20;

    if (age > 20) {
        console.log("Age is over 21");
    } else {
        console.log("Age is under 21");
    }

    // We can check the type of the value that a variable currently contains using the `typeof` keyword
    // It evaluates to a string describing the type. Comment out the following line to see:

     console.log( typeof "hello" );

    // 2. Create a variable named `unknown` and assign a number to it.
    // -  Use if-else-if statements to manipulate the variable in different ways depending on its type
    // -  If the variable is a number: add 10 to it and print the result to the console
    // -  If the variable is a string: print out its length (search google of stack overflow for help)
    // -  If the variable is undefined: log to the console that the variable is undefined
    // -  Change the value you assign to the variable to make sure each branch of the if statement is executed
    var unknown ;

    if (typeof unknown == "number") {
        unknown = unknown + 10;
        console.log(unknown);
    } else if (typeof unknown == "string") {
        console.log(unknown.length);
    } else if (typeof unknown == "undefined") {
        console.log("Variable is undefined.");
    }

    // We looked at while loops in our class material but there are also for loops.
    // A for loop has  an initialization, an end condition, and an iteration followed by a code block.
    // The conditions and iteration statements are separated by semicolons and are inside a parenthesis.
    // A variable is usually initialized, checked and iterated by a for loop, and then used in the for loop
    // It's syntax looks like:

    // for ( initialization ; end condition ; iteration )
    // {
    //   ...
    // }

    // 3. Fill in the following for loop so that you simply log the value of the variable `i` used in the loop:
    // -  Notice that we use var to initialize the for loop variable `i`
    // -  What should the loop print out?

    for ( var i = 0; i < 100; i = i + 1 ) {
        console.log(i);
    }

    // 4. Use a for loop to loop over the numbers 100 to 200, incrementing by 10 each time
    // -  Confirm that your for loop is working by logging the loop variable inside the code block
    // -  Use an if-else statement inside the for loop to check if the number is equal to 150.
    // -  If it is, don't log it to the console. There are a couple ways to do this. Find at least two.
    for (var i = 100; i <= 200; i = i + 10) {
        if (i != 150) {
            console.log(i);
        } 


    }

    
    // -  Use a series of if-else-if statements to determine the winner of the game
    // -  Log the result of the game as "Player 1 won", "Player 2 won", or "Players tied"
 

    // 6. Make sure you are reading Eloquent JavaScript and practicing the exercises there!
    // -  Especially be reading Chapter 2, Program Structure


    // Chapter 2 of Eloquent JavaScript describes how to use the prompt and alert functions
    // to display a dialog box in the browser and get values from the user. Uncomment the 
    // following lines to see an example:

    // alert("I'm sending you a message");

    // var name = prompt("Tell me your name:");
    // console.log(name);

    // 7. Convert your rock-paper-scissors game to an interactive game.
    // -  Ask the two players for their choice and then alert them of the game's result
    var player1 = prompt("Rock, paper, or scissors?");
    var player2 = prompt("Rock, paper, or scissors?");

    if ((player1 == "rock" && player2 == "scissors") || (player1 == "paper" && player2 == "rock") || (player1 == "scissors" && player2 == "paper")) {
        alert("Player 1 wins!");
    } else if ((player1 == "rock" && player2 == "paper") || (player1 == "paper" && player2 == "scissors") || (player1 == "scissors" && player2 == "rock")) {
        alert("Player 2 wins!");
    } else {
        alert("You either tied or played the game wrong!");
    }
